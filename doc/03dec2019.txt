Block
- Scan each exp and gather them in doers
	- Simple print
	- Value (resolve alias and methods statically)
		- Use Path?
	- Embedded Block
	- Embedded calls (must be resolved statically)
		- resolve & validate paths
		- When processing the calls, the text is attached to an anchor.

// Need to produce a new document as fast as possible
Block
	- Compute all local values (local for this block)
	- Resolve each local Aliases (Paths)
	- Scan each doers and inject values (Paths)
	- Iterate each embedded blocks and inject values (Paths)
	
Anchors
	- An anchor is a pointer to the current writing position.
	- It is given a name and stored in a map.
	- Each anchor has a before and an after list.
Writing the final text
	(When processing the anchors, it is necessary to start from the last otherwise we would need to adjust the preceding achors pointers...)
	- we start by ordering the anchor (starting from the end)
	- We output the text til the first anchor
	- We iterate the after list from the end
	- Then iterate the before list from the start
	- Then continue to output the text til the next anchor
	
### An other way is to create a new stream by inserting the previous stream text and the anchor text in order!

To test:
- Matching multiple alias in multiple places.
- Associating multiple alias to the same value.
